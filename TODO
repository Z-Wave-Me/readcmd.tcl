1. add entered command to command history automatically(in read_sync proc)?
2. reorder args for read_sync proc; may be: prompt, histo, cmds, exit_cmd, kbindings
3. add reading a conf for readcmd lib($::env(HOME)/.readcmdrc)? I think, just one thing
  need to be placed there - a configuration of readcmd::kbindings. Everything else should
  be placed in a config of a program that use readcmd lib
4. place stty path to conf?
5. place debug switch into conf?
6. add chan arg to term_set_raw and term_unset_raw?
7. add read_async proc
10. tclshrc: add autocompletion
11. tclshrc: add history saving/loading
12. add multiline support
13. add key sequence support(e.g. ctrl-x + tab to insert tab)
14. add chan arg to read_sync?
15. improve README
