1. add entered command to command history automatically(in read_sync proc)?
2. reorder args for read_sync proc; may be: prompt, histo, cmds, exit_cmd, kbindings
3. add reading a conf for readcmd lib($::env(HOME)/.readcmdrc)? I think, just one thing
  need to be placed there - a configuration of readcmd::kbindings. Everything else should
  be placed in a config of a program that use readcmd lib
4. place stty path to conf?
5. place debug switch into conf?
6. add chan arg to term_set_raw and term_unset_raw?
7. add read_async proc
10. tclshrc: add autocompletion
12. add multiline support
13. add key sequence support(e.g. ctrl-x + tab to insert tab)
14. add chan arg to read_sync?
15. improve README
16. tclshrc: create second variant of tclshrc where external commands(from OS, like ls, mkdir, etc) will work
17. tclshrc: add interp alias for history command that list previous commands
18. tclshrc: add support for call previous command with bash-like syntax !CMD_INDEX
19. tclshrc: add support for ctrl-r/ctrl-s to search history backward/forward
